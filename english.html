<p>ChiSingTan Beach’s Extraordinary Sea Landscape with Sand Stones and Peaceful Activity

ChiSingTan Beach in Hualien, Taiwan is a very popular tourist attraction and is famous for its colourful stone views. My friends and I went there for our Edu Trip. We experienced these landscapes with joy. The seawater was clear and blue. We touched and felt the smooth round stones with our bare hands. It was such a new experience to see clouds made of cotton candy blended with a sea made of glass. The wind whispered to us “Have fun with your friends here” Those landscapes were well-painted like an oil painting. These extraordinary views made a lovely landscape.

=> Phenomenal View of ChiSingTan
The beauty of ChiSingTan is phenomenal. We saw the gradation of clear blue water with white foams in the sea. The sea approached us with excitement and waves. The most outstanding part is that natural stones cover the beach ground. These natural stones are not only round and smooth, they are as rare as a stretch of beads. This landscape as an oil painting makes it a phenomenal beauty.

=> Sand of Stones in ChiSingTan
ChiSingTan stones are delicate. These stores are formed by erosion by the sea water and it starts over and over again to create the smooth-round texture. Those natural-made marbles filled the view. The endless carpet of stones seemed infinity. We even experienced stepping smooth stones-filled ground made by erosion. The ground is unique due to its formation process.

=> Peaceful and Relaxing Activities
We had a joyful time in ChiSingTan. We made a stack of stones. The stack looked like a mountain of colourful clay and contrasted with the ocean-blue panorama. We kept these moments in our camera. These heavenly panorama were captured perfectly because we loved to take pictures there. The peaceful things here are not just the activities, but also the clean and well-treated environment. No trash can be seen by eyes. This reflects that Taiwanese are caring about their environment and they protect their nature. Correspondingly, the sea smiles at us to give dazzling gifts in return. Moreover, we got to see clear sea water that was calm and serene. Again, ChiSingTan is a splendid place to do peaceful and relaxing activities because of its pure scenery.

The charms of ChiSingTan Beach are unique in their way. This wonderful beach with special sea outlook with sand of stones and serene activities. I recommend you to come here with a big friend group to share enjoyable memories. But, we have to keep this nature. We have to protect them by not littering. Let's protect our environment to see more beauty of nature like ChiSingTan beach.
